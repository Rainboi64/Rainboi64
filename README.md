### Help me out!
 any contribution to my ongoing projects is seriously appreciated *(seriously)
 ### Fluint
- This project was born out of the frustrations of the cumbersome, non-intuitive, level design process that modern 3D tools provide. our mission with this project is to build a utility that's aimed at making the level design process as efficient and mindless as possible, we want to provide powerful yet fluent tools for the designer.
 ### The Language
- A modern programming language that uses the Arabic scripts. and aims to expand the usage of the awesome Arabic language in the tech industry.
